**Version 1.0 :** This version can only identify if you're showing **Positive**, **Negative** or **Neutral** Mental Signs.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This was due to lack of suitable medical data that could serve as training material for an ML Model.
